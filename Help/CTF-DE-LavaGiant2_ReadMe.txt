Description
-----------
The map originally created by Juan Pancho 'XceptOne' Eekels. It was part of the DE Bonus Pack for UT2003. It was left out of UT2004 because of collision holes during the conversion from UT2003 to UT2004.
I fixed the holes and converted it to UT2004... The only things I changed besides all errors during conversion: I added some more Lift Exists at the bases, which higher skilled bots can use to liftjump out of the bases, especially when carrying the flag.
Otherwise I kept the map in its original state.

Don't give me any credit for that map, I didn't made it, I just converted it to UT2004 to make it "complete" again. ;)

Installation
------------
Put the CTF-DE-LavaGiant2.ut2 file into you Map directory.
